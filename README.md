# Driving Cloud9 Sagemaker Endpoint

<p>
Train a Sagemaker model that can drive through an environment by selecting one of three outputs(left, right, straight) for each initialization.
The training set was created manual through running  training.py. The arrow keys drive the car on the sine wave track. The road display is always relative to the car. Think of it as data from a sensor array on the front of the car.
